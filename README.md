# Auto-Shodanner
(name in progress)

Shodan is expensive, IVRE is painful to set up, and there aren't really any other good alternitives. So why not make my own version that is good in those regards?   

Todo:
- Actually save data
- Scan settings page
- data on currently ongoing scan
- Result data Visualization
- Result data search page
- Implement many protocols.
- Performance optimizations
- Make scanning faster.
- Make into a Debian package?
